Step-by-Step Development
Setup and Environment:

Initialize a Node.js project with Express.js.
Set up MongoDB (local or cloud with MongoDB Atlas).
Install essential libraries (mongoose, dotenv, jsonwebtoken, etc.).

Database Schema:

Create schemas for User and Expense:
User: name, email, password.
Expense: userId, amount, category, date, note.

Basic Routes:

User Routes:
POST /signup: Register a new user.
POST /login: Authenticate user and return a token.

Expense Routes:
POST /expenses: Add a new expense.
GET /expenses: Fetch all expenses for the logged-in user.
PUT /expenses/:id : Update an expense.
DELETE /expenses/:id: Remove an expense.


Authentication Middleware:
Protect expense routes so only logged-in users can access their data.

Validation:
Validate input data (e.g., amounts must be positive, category should be predefined).

Testing:
Use Postman to test all endpoints.
Ensure authentication works as expected.
